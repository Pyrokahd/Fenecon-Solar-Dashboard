# Fenecon-Solar-Dashboard
A web app for logging and displaying solar voltage values for a fenecon solar collector system. \
It primarly displays the average (average over all battery cells) voltage for every battery module. Every module has 14 cells. These values are collected from the battery tower using the fenecon API and then stored in a csv file.

*Currently 10 modules are expected in the collection script. There is yet no config file to change it*

There are two applications each is ruin as its own process or docker container:
- The data logging script at data_logging_Scripts/collectDataVoltageV5.py
- the dashboard app (the files outside data_logging_scripts)

The URLs in the data_collection_script (data_logging_Scripts/collectDataVoltageV5.py) may need to be changed depending on your battery modules ip addres.

# deploying using docker
On the host machine:

## On Linux / raspberry pi
**1. install docker** (here with convenience script)
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```
Other options on [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

**2. Check installation** by running hello-world
```
sudo docker run hello-world
```

**3. Clone this repository** (git should be preinstalled in most linux systems)
navigate to a target directory then:
```
git clone https://github.com/Pyrokahd/Fenecon-Solar-Dashboard.git
```

### Start data collections script
**1. Open a terminal**
**2. Navigate to data_logging_scripts directory** in this repo (...\Fenecon-Solar-Dashboard\data_logging_scripts)
**3. Change API URL to your battery tower**
Open the config.json file and adjust the IP address to your local adress from your battery tower.
**4. Create docker image** 
```
docker build -t datacollection-docker .
```
**5. Create a docker Volume** (to persistently save the data outside a docker container)
```
docker volume create fenDataVolume
```
**6. Run image in a docker container** (with mounted volume)
```
docker run --mount source=fenDataVolume,destination=/app/data datacollection-docker
```

### Start Dashboard server
**1. Open a new terminal**
**2. Navigate to this repo** (...\Fenecon-Solar-Dashboard)
**3. Create docker image** 
```
docker build -t fdashboard-docker .
```
**4. Create a docker Volume** (should already be there from step 4 in the previous section, but calling it twice doesn't hurt)
```
docker volume create fenDataVolume
```
**5. Run image in a docker container** (with access to port 80 and with mounted volume)
```
docker run --publish 80:80 --mount source=fenDataVolume,destination=/app/data fdashboard-docker
```
**6. Wait 4 minutes** (The data collection first needs to create the csv file by making API requests)
**7. check your local ip adress
In a new Terminal enter:
```
ifconfig
```
The Ip adress is something like 192.168.1...
**8. Enter that IP adress into a browser** on a machine connected to the same network


## On Windows


1. install docker on target computer
2. clone this repo
3. Open two consoles (one for every process)

## data collection
1. Navigate to data_logging_scripts in this repo (...\Fenecon-Solar-Dashboard\data_logging_scripts)
3. create image
`docker build -t datacollection-docker .`
3. create volume (for persistent data)
`docker volume create fenDataVolume`
4. run as container
`docker run --mount source=fenDataVolume,destination=/app/data datacollection-docker`

It collects the current data every 5 minutes via the API.

## dashboard
1. Navigate to this repo (...\Fenecon-Solar-Dashboard)
2. create image
`docker build -t fdashboard-docker .`
3. create volume (for persistent data)
`docker volume create fenDataVolume`
4. run as container (on port 80)
`docker run --publish 80:80 --mount source=fenDataVolume,destination=/app/data fdashboard-docker`
5. look up the local ip address of that computer
6. Enter that url on port 80 into the browser (example: http://192.168.1.47:80/)

## file storage
The created csv file is stored in the docker containers and shared on the volume. 

Docker volumes can be found in windows (with WSL enabled - linux for **windows**) via the filebrowser \
File browser enter: `\\wsl$\docker-desktop-data\data\docker\volumes`

In Linux the path is:
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/`

# Other info
Show Images installed:
```
docker image ls
```
Show created volumes:
```
docker volume ls
```
Show docker container:
```
docker container ls
```
Stop and remove docker container:
```
docker stop <Container_ID> docker rm <Container_ID>
```

# Troubleshooting
There seems to be an issue when starting the dashboard before the csv is generated by the dataCollectionScript. It helps to wait about 5 min before starting the container with the dashboard app. Or restart the dashboard container if site does not load or loads but does not display data. (If there is only 1 data row collected, it may look like there is no data displayer)
